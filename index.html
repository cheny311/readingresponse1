          <p>Reading this website give me a confusing time of linking all the information acrossing the layout.</p>
        <p>"Even though we have access to worldwide content from our computers and smartphones, Internet usage is still determined by local needs and customs. The Internet adapts itself to suit the realities of each region."

            This quote reminds me of the time when I saw all the amazingly designed websites online, but I could only create basic ones for myself. The power of the internet is unlimited, but people tend to impose many limitations due to various reasons. Some, like me, lack the necessary skills, while others face different political expectations. I remember back in my hometown, accessing different applications required a VPN, which serves as a great example of how the internet adapts itself to suit the realities of each region and how people navigate the internet.

   <p>"The idea of wandering is omnipresent; the stroll, this promenade without a goal, without any destination or home port, is the Internet's initial activity."I enjoy this quote very much since there are many times when I get trapped in the action of strolling and forget the intention of my searching. At the same time, I agree with the idea of having no goal; it is the best part of the internet, where you can just relax and leave all other thoughts behind while enjoying the aesthetic aspect of different design pages. Some of the designs may lack aesthetics, but they serve as a way for people to get straightforward information. Others have taken me to the world of beauty.
